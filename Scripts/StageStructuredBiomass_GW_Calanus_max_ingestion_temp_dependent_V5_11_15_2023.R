#                   population model to a stage-structured biomass model.

#
#                   This model forms the basis for the stage-structured biomass model
#                   analyzed in:
#
#                   A.M. de Roos et al., 2007. Food-dependent growth leads to
#                   overcompensation in stage- specific biomass when mortality
#                   increases: the influence of maturation versus reproduction
#                   regulation. American Naturalist 170: E59-E76.
#
#                   Consumers hence follow a net-production DEB model with scaling
#                   functions of ingestion and maintenance proportional to body size.
#                   Juveniles and adults use all their net-production for growth and
#                   reproduction, respectively.
#
#                   The variable that is solved for is the biomass of the resource.

#   Model i-state variables:
#     1 : Age
#     2 : Size
#
#   Model of environmental state variables:
#     1 : Resource
#
#   Model interaction (and output) variables:
#     1 : Total resource ingestion by the consumer population
#     2 : Total biomass of juveniles
#     3 : Total biomass of adults
#     4 : Net Production

# Model dimension variables: PSPMdimensions (required)
#
# Define a numerical (integer) vector called 'PSPMdimensions' that specifies the
# dimensions of the model. The vector should include the following named vecctor
# elements:
#
# PopulationNr:       The number of populations in the model that are structured,
#                     that is, of which the life history of individuals is explicitly
#                     modelled
# IStateDimension:    The number of individual state variables that characterise the
#                     individuals in the structured populations. This number should be
#                     the same for all structured populations in the model
# LifeHistoryStages:  The number of distinct and discrete stages in the life history
#                     of the individuals. A part of the individual life history is
#                     considered a stage, when at the boundary of this part one of the
#                     life history processes (development, fecundity, mortality or
#                     impact) changes discontinuously
# ImpactDimension:    The number of functions that represent the impact of an individual
#                     on its environment. At the population level these impacts
#                     affect the dynamics of the environemtal state variables and hence
#                     determine their equilibrium values. Impact functions can, however,
#                     also be used to extract certain output information on the
#                     structured populations (such as number of biomass of juveniles and
#                     adults) as all population-level values of the impact functions
#                     are reported as output.

# Variable name: EnvironmentState (required)
#
# Define a vector called 'EnvironmentState' with a length equal to the number of
# environmental state variables in the problem. Each element of this vector should be
# one of the strings "PERCAPITARATE", "GENERALODE" or "POPULATIONINTEGRAL", defining
# the nature or type of environmental state variable. The 3 different types are defined
# as follows:
#
# Set an entry to "PERCAPITARATE" if the dynamics of E[j] follow an ODE and 0
# is a possible equilibrium state of E[j]. The ODE is then of the form
# dE[j]/dt = P(E,I)*E[j], with P(E,I) the per capita growth rate of E[j].
# Specify the equilibrium condition as condition[j] = P(E,I), do not include
# the multiplication with E[j] to allow for detecting and continuing the
# transcritical bifurcation between the trivial and non-trivial equilibrium.
#
# Set an entry to "GENERALODE" if the dynamics of E[j] follow an ODE and 0 is
# NOT an equilibrium state of E. The ODE then has a form dE[j]/dt = G(E,I).
# Specify the equilibrium condition as condition[j] = G(E,I).
#
# Set an entry to "POPULATIONINTEGRAL" if E[j] is a (weighted) integral of the
# population distribution, representing for example the total population
# biomass. E[j] then can be expressed as E[j] = I[p][i]. Specify the

# development:  A vector of length equal to the number of i-state variables. Each element
#               specifies the rate of development for the particular i-state variable.
#               In case the model accounts for multiple, structured populations this component
#               should be a matrix with the number of rows equal to the number of structured
#               populations in the problem and the number of columns equal to the number of
#               i-state variables.
# fecundity:    The value of the current fecundity of the individual.
#               In case the model accounts for multiple, structured populations this argument
#               is a matrix of fecundities with the number of rows equal to the number
#               of structured populations in the problem and a single column.
#               In case individuals can be born with different states at birth the component
#               should have a number of columns equal to the number of states at birth. Each
#               column should specify the number of offspring produced with the particular
#               state at birth.
# mortality:    A single value specifying the current mortality rate that the individual experiences.
#               In case the model accounts for multiple, structured populations this argument
#               is a vector of mortality rates with the number of elements equal to the number
#               of structured populations in the problem.
# impact:       A single value or a vector of a length equal to the number of impact functions that
#               need to be monitored for the individual. The value (or the values of the vector)
#               should specify the current contribution of the individual to this population-level
#               impact.
#               In case the model accounts for multiple, structured populations this component
#               should be a matrix with the number of rows equal to the number of structured
#               populations in the problem and the number of columns equal to the number of impact
#               functions.
